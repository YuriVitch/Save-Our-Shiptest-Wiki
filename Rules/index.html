	-- General Rules --<br>
1. Don't be a dick. <br>
We're all supposed to be here to have a good time, actively trying to fuck over other players of the same ship is a no-go. Off-ship, see #3 and #4.<br>
<br>
2. No ERP.<br>
This isn't the place or it. Period.<br>
<br>
3. Flag your ship appropriately.<br>
Follow the flag and faction conventions to properly communicate to other ships how to interact with you. Valid names include "ISV Five Ninths Already", "[NTRL] Pyre's Sea", and "[AGRS] SSV Mickey's Dick Smasher".<br>
Valid Combat Tags are as follows:<br>
No Tag/[FRN] - Friendly<br>
[NTRL]/[NEUT] - Neutral<br>
[AGRS]/[HOS] - Aggressive/Hostile<br>
<br>
4. Tag your ship with the correct faction.<br>
The exact naming convention is "Faction, Purpose, Type." For example,<br>
NTSV (Nanotrasen Space Vessel) is valid, as is IMC (Independent Medical Crusier), and SCF (Syndicate Cargo Frigate). Purpose and type being accurate will not, and never has been enforced, though it's good to have regardless.<br>
<br>
5. When in doubt, Ahelp.<br>
Seriously. We're malleable as hell right now, just shoot a prayer or an ahelp if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
--- Silicon Policies ---<br>
<br>
1. In regards to Asimov and it's equivalents, future harm and magnitude is irrelevant. Prioritize what's in the now, even if that's just a guy being punched.<br>
2. Purposefully obtuse and/or tedious orders may be ignored.<br>
